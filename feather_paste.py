"""
PLUG-in for gimp 2.8 and 2.9
(might work with previous versions)

Allows one to paste the contents of the
clipboard in an image with its contents
feathered from the border.

The ammoutn of feathreing is selected interactively
during the Plug-in execution, in a call to
the Gaussian Blur plug-in.

WHen the Gaussian blur dialog pops-up, one is free
to select the pasted temporary layer
on the Layers dialog and move it around to the
desired location.
